### Hi, I'm Ole! :wave:
<hr>
I'm a 20 y/o CS student from Germany (he/him), trying to learn a bunch of stuff. I've tried out a bunch of languages and tech, but I feel pretty comfortable with NodeJS.
I've been using Vue for frontend (whenever I work on a frontend - doesn't happen that often) and love to make good ol' REST APIs with Express.
<br>
As for scripting languages I :heart: Golang and Python!
