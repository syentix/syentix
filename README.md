## Hi, I'm Syentix! :wave:

I'm a CS student from Germany (he/him), trying to learn a bunch of stuff. I've tried out a bunch of languages and tech, but I feel pretty comfortable with NodeJS.
<hr>

### What I like to use:

* Vue for frontend
* Have been using .NET for backends, but I like a good ol' js backend
* Python for scripting, would like to delve into Rust :smile:
<hr>

That's all I guess, enjoy your stay :smile:
