### Hi, I'm Ole! :wave:
<hr>
I'm a 20 y/o CS student from Germany (he/him), trying to learn a bunch of stuff. I've tried out a bunch of languages and tech, but I feel pretty comfortable with NodeJS.
<br>
What I like to use:

* Vue (Frontend, when I actually touch a frontend)
* Express and MongoDB (Backend)
* :heart: Golang and Python for scripting :smile:
<br>
Some other fun facts! :balloon:

* I love to play and watch :baseball:
* I always like to work with people on something and get it done together :muscle:

That's all I guess, enjoy your stay :smile:
